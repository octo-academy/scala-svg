#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in the
#     body
#   * All the lines starting with "#" will be ignored by git thus
#     you can keep these comments stay
